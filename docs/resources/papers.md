## Papers List

### MCMC in general

- D. W. Hogg, D. Foreman-Mackey (2017), [Data analysis recipes: Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06068.pdf)

Gives a brief overview of the most basic MCMC method and some practical advice for the use of MCMC in real inference problems. Also gives advice on method choice, tuning for performance, methods for initialisation, tests of convergence, troubleshooting, and use of the chain output to produce or report parameter estimates with associated uncertainties.

- C. Andrieu (2003), [An Introduction to MCMC for Machine Learning](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~arnaud/andrieu_defreitas_doucet_jordan_intromontecarlomachinelearning.pdf)

First, it introduces the Monte Carlo method with emphasis on probabilistic machine learning. Second, it reviews the main building blocks of modern Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, thereby providing and introduction to the remaining papers of this special issue. Lastly, it discusses new interesting research horizons.

- Columbia University (2017), [MCMC and Bayesian Modeling](http://www.columbia.edu/~mh2078/MachineLearningORFE/MCMC_Bayes.pdf)

Lecture notes that provide an introduction to Bayesian modeling and MCMC algorithms including the Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Sampling algorithms. Challenges discussed along with questions regarding convergence. Convergence diagnostics also introduced.

- G Reinert (2005), [Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Applied Bayesian Statistics](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~reinert/mcmc/mcmc.pdf)

Good overall theoretical guide for Bayesian Statistics and MCMC.

### Transition Kernel

- A. Gelman, G. O. Roberts, W. R. Gilks (1996),[Efficient Metropolis Jumping Rules](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/baystat5.pdf)

Provides good heuristics about tuning a spherically symmetric gaussian kernel.

- Chris Sherlock, Paul Fearnhead and Gareth O. Roberts (2010), [The Random Walk Metropolis: Linking Theory and Practice Through a Case Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.6217.pdf)

Provides good explanation about different transition kernels.
